			<Text>Traditional sources attribute the invention of the chariot to the Xia Dynasty minister Xi Zhong, and say they were used at the Battle of Gan in the 21st century BC. However, archeological evidence shows that small scale use of the chariot began around 1200 BC in the late Shang Dynasty primarily as mobile command vehicles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Because horses provided crucial motive power, the ma or "horse officer" seems to have been entrusted with proportionately greatly authority. To the extent that chariots formed a core component of the army, the tuo ma ("chief ma") appears to have controlled contingents of the standing army; assumed a command role on the battlefield, being deputed on campaigns to attack enemy states; been entrusted with defensive responsibilities that extended to the ruler; and also directed the royal hunt on occasion.</Text>
