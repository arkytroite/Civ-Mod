				Piazza San Marco cannot be built until much later than the Circus Maximus, which it replaces. However, it provides four luxuries that can be used to greatly enhance happiness or trade, and a free harbor that will allow wider trade opportunities.

				Piazza San Marco is the principal public square of Venice, Italy, where it is generally known just as "the Piazza" (la Piazza). All other urban spaces in the city (except the Piazzetta and the Piazzale Roma) are called "campi" (fields). The Piazzetta (the 'little Piazza') is an extension of the Piazza towards the lagoon in its south east corner (see plan). The two spaces together form the social, religious and political centre of Venice.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A remark usually attributed to Napoleon calls the Piazza San Marco "the drawing room of Europe".
