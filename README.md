# Features 
## New unique components
* Adds four unique components to each civilization, for a total of 6 per civ.  
* Components include buildings, units, and improvements, all with new art.  
* The first priority was to make civs with overly straightforward gameplans more unique in their decision making.  
* The second priority was to strengthen weak civs and to make overly swingy civs more secure by giving them meaningful access to their gameplan.
* Adjusts the Netherland's Polders to convert ocean tiles into farmland, as they do in real life.
## Policy Overhaul
### Adds three new Policy Trees
* Security is ideal for defense and internal development. It increases all yeilds by a moderate amount, focusing most on Growth.
* Authority is best for aggressive civs. While Honor focuses on your soldiers, Authority focuses on your Armor and Naval Units.
* Statecraft is best for making friends. It helps produce Tourism, City-State Influence, and World Congress Delegates.
### Rebalances existing Policy Trees
* Completing the Liberty tree now grants +50% Production towards National Wonders and +10% Production towards all buildings.
## Slavery
Makes captured civilian units turn into slaves, which are less effective than workers and may revolt.
## New Units
Adds new buildable units, including an upgrade path for the scout, mercenary army units for later in the game, and an extremely cheap ancient era military unit.
## Detout Technologies
Adds new tile improvements that require new "detour" technologies to build. These improvements are not focused on yields, but rather utility. One such technology gives access to hand-axemen.
## Cloth Mill
Adds the cloth mill, which provides gold for textile resources.
